# Mini Free Library - Backend

This is the backend repository.

Check out the backend repository [here](https://github.com/serenalin121/mini-free-library-backend).

See the project in action [here](https://mini-free-library-frontend.herokuapp.com/).

## Project Description
Have you seen those mini-libraries in your community? People put a box or crate of books in their front yard. Neighbors browse and return later. For this app, I created a system to help library owners to manage books in their libraries. The book information was pull from the Open Library API (https://openlibrary.org/developers/api). Also, this system can assist people who want to borrow a book to track the library inventory before they visit. I used Mapbox map (https://www.mapbox.com/) to display the library locations. 

Both admin and user can create an account by providing email and password information. Or they can choose third party Google log in.

## Technology Used and Approaches
- The website is a MERN stack project. (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)
- This app is mobile friendly.
- The backend contains 4 different modele: admin, user, book and library. Both admin model and user model storing a user's login information. Bcrypt is used to maintain security for user passwords.
- Admin and User can choose to log in with their gmail account. Google OAuth and Passport Js are used for this feature.
- The Material-UI is used for styling of the pages
- The app is being hosted on MongoDB Atlas and deployed on Heroku
- Third Party APIs used are: 
    - Open Library API - for book information and cover image
    - Mapbox API - for admins to add a new library and display all libraries for users
